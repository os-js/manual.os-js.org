# Core Tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to interact with the core.

## Usage

The `core` variable injected into API signatures contains a reference to the `Core` instance.

It is used to interact with service providers, read configuration(s) and other core functionality.

### Common

These methods are shared between the server and client:

```javascript
// Gets a configuration value
const value = core.config('resolve.by.key', 'optional default value');

// Retrieves an instance of a service
const service = core.make('namespace/service');

// Registers a new ServiceProvicer class
core.register(SomeServiceProvider, {/* registration options */});

// Registers a new singleton factory for service
core.singleton('namespace/service', () => new SomeService());

// Registers a new instance factory for service
core.instance('namespace/service', () => new SomeService());

// Checks if given service exists
const exists = core.has('namespace/service');

// Subscribe to an event
core.on('event-name', () => {});
```

### Client

The client has some extra methods for dealing with user data, requests, resources and applications:

```javascript
// Creates a URL based on the public path
const url = core.url('/foo/bar');

// Creates a new fetch() request
const promise = core.request('http://url', {/* options */}, 'type')

// Launches an application
core.run('Preview', {file: {path: 'home://image.png'}})

// Launches a new application based on a file
core.open({path: 'home://image.png', mime: 'image/png'});

// Gets user data
const user = core.getUser();
```

#### Global 'OSjs' namespace

The window global `OSjs` also lets you reach some of the core functionality.

```javascript
// Same as above (but some services are restricted)
OSjs.make();

// These are the same as above
OSjs.open();
OSjs.request();
OSjs.run();
OSjs.url();
```

#### Client Events

These are the default provided services and their signatures:

* `osjs/session => ()` - APIs for [Session](https://manual.os-js.org/v3/api/osjs-client/class/src/session.js~Session.html)
* `osjs/desktop => ()` - APIs for desktop
* `osjs/panels => ()`- APIs for panels

Example:

```javascript
core.make('osjs/settings').save();
```

### Server

The server also has some extra methods:

```javascript
// Broadcast an event to all connected users (WebSocket)
core.broadcast('event-name', [1, 2, 3])

// Broadcast an event to a set of users
core.broadcast('event-name', [1, 2, 3], ws => {
  //The original 'req' containing session etc
  //ws.upgradeReq

  //The original session data
  //ws._osjs_client

  return true;
});

// Broadcast to all alias but with expanded arguments:
core.broadcastAll('event-name', 1, 2 , 3);

// Broadcast to a specific user, with expanded arguments:
core.broadcastAll('username', 'event-name', 1, 2 , 3);

// Express server
const app = core.app;

// WebSocket server
const ws = core.ws;

// Session server
const session = core.session;
```

> [info] You can listen for broadcast events in the client with

```
// Client-side example:
core.on('event-name', (a, b, c) => console.log(a, b, c)) // => 1 2 3
```

#### Events

* `init => ()` - Main init
* `osjs/core:start => ()` - Core start
* `osjs/core:started => ()` - Core started
